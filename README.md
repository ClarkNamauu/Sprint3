# Overview

In Android Studio made a counter app that as you hit the increase button the counter will increase and as you hit the decrease button the value will go down. Created this app since I have never tried making an app before and it has been an interesting experince making my self grow.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
